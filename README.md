This project is a simple recreation of the google homepage using only html and css. Since there is no JS there is no real function of the site, it is only my first project so i plan on redoing this later with JS. the skills i demonstrated with this project are many diferent ways of positioning divs with css, a strong knowledge of html format, ability to deconstruct a site using dev tools and recreate the site in my own formating.
